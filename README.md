### Integration Setup

## Session Token
In order to authenticate to the Carelink server, the Carelink client needs a valid access token. This can be obtained by manually logging into a Carelink follower account via Carelink web page. After successful login, the access token (plus country code) can be shown and copied using the Cookie Quick Manager Firefox plugin as follows:

- With the Carelink web page still active, open Cookie Quick Manger from the extensions menu
- Select option "Search Cookies: carelink.minimed.eu"
- Copy value of auth temp token and use it as Session token for initial setup of the Homeassistant Carelink integration 


### Enable debug logging

The [logger](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/logger/) integration lets you define the level of logging activities in Home Assistant. Turning on debug mode will show more information about unsupported devices in your logbook.

```yaml
logger:
  default: critical
  logs:
    custom_components.carelink: debug
```
